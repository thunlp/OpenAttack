## Usage Examples

#### Attack Built-in Victim Models

OpenAttack builds in some commonly used NLP models like BERT ([Devlin et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)) and RoBERTa ([Liu et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692)) that have been fine-tuned on some commonly used datasets (such as [SST-2](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/treebank.html)). You can effortlessly conduct adversarial attacks against these built-in victim models.

The following code snippet shows how to use PWWS, a greedy algorithm-based attack model ([Ren et al., 2019](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1103.pdf)), to attack BERT on the SST-2 dataset (the complete executable code is [here](./examples/workflow.py)).

```python
import OpenAttack as oa
import datasets # use the Hugging Face's datasets library
# change the SST dataset into 2-class
def dataset_mapping(x):
    return {
        "x": x["sentence"],
        "y": 1 if x["label"] > 0.5 else 0,
    }
# choose a trained victim classification model
victim = oa.DataManager.loadVictim("BERT.SST")
# choose 20 examples from SST-2 as the evaluation data 
dataset = datasets.load_dataset("sst", split="train[:20]").map(function=dataset_mapping)
# choose PWWS as the attacker and initialize it with default parameters
attacker = oa.attackers.PWWSAttacker()
# prepare for attacking
attack_eval = oa.AttackEval(attacker, victim)
# launch attacks and print attack results 
attack_eval.eval(dataset, visualize=True)
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Customized Victim Model</strong></summary>

The following code snippet shows how to use PWWS to attack a **customized sentiment analysis model** (a statistical model built in NLTK) on SST-2 (the complete executable code is [here](./examples/custom_victim.py)).

```python
import OpenAttack as oa
import numpy as np
import datasets
import nltk
from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer


# configure access interface of the customized victim model by extending OpenAttack.Classifier.
class MyClassifier(oa.Classifier):
    def __init__(self):
        # nltk.sentiment.vader.SentimentIntensityAnalyzer is a traditional sentiment classification model.
        nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
        self.model = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
    
    def get_pred(self, input_):
        return self.get_prob(input_).argmax(axis=1)

    # access to the classification probability scores with respect input sentences
    def get_prob(self, input_):
        ret = []
        for sent in input_:
            # SentimentIntensityAnalyzer calculates scores of ‚Äúneg‚Äù and ‚Äúpos‚Äù for each instance
            res = self.model.polarity_scores(sent)

            # we use ùë†ùëúùëêùëüùëí_ùëùùëúùë† / (ùë†ùëêùëúùëüùëí_ùëõùëíùëî + ùë†ùëêùëúùëüùëí_ùëùùëúùë†) to represent the probability of positive sentiment
            # Adding 10^‚àí6 is a trick to avoid dividing by zero.
            prob = (res["pos"] + 1e-6) / (res["neg"] + res["pos"] + 2e-6)

            ret.append(np.array([1 - prob, prob]))
        
        # The get_prob method finally returns a np.ndarray of shape (len(input_), 2). See Classifier for detail.
        return np.array(ret)

def dataset_mapping(x):
    return {
        "x": x["sentence"],
        "y": 1 if x["label"] > 0.5 else 0,
    }
    
# load some examples of SST-2 for evaluation
dataset = datasets.load_dataset("sst", split="train[:20]").map(function=dataset_mapping)
# choose the costomized classifier as the victim model
victim = MyClassifier()
# choose PWWS as the attacker and initialize it with default parameters
attacker = oa.attackers.PWWSAttacker()
# prepare for attacking
attack_eval = oa.AttackEval(attacker, victim)
# launch attacks and print attack results 
attack_eval.eval(dataset, visualize=True)
```
</details>


<details>
<summary><strong>Customized Dataset</strong></summary>

The following code snippet shows how to use PWWS to attack an existing fine-tuned sentiment analysis model on a **customized** dataset (the complete executable code is [here](./examples/custom_dataset.py)).

```python
import OpenAttack as oa
import transformers
import datasets

# load a fine-tuned sentiment analysis model from Transformers (you can also use our fine-tuned Victim.BERT.SST)
tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("echarlaix/bert-base-uncased-sst2-acc91.1-d37-hybrid")
model = transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("echarlaix/bert-base-uncased-sst2-acc91.1-d37-hybrid", num_labels=2, output_hidden_states=False)
victim = oa.classifiers.TransformersClassifier(model, tokenizer, model.bert.embeddings.word_embeddings)

# choose PWWS as the attacker and initialize it with default parameters
attacker = oa.attackers.PWWSAttacker()

# create your customized dataset
dataset = datasets.Dataset.from_dict({
    "x": [
        "I hate this movie.",
        "I like this apple."
    ],
    "y": [
        0, # 0 for negative
        1, # 1 for positive
    ]
})

# prepare for attacking
attack_eval = oa.AttackEval(attacker, victim, metrics = [oa.metric.EditDistance(), oa.metric.ModificationRate()])
# launch attacks and print attack results
attack_eval.eval(dataset, visualize=True)
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Multiprocessing</strong></summary>

OpenAttack supports convenient multiprocessing to accelerate the process of adversarial attacks. The following code snippet shows how to use multiprocessing in adversarial attacks with Genetic ([Alzantot et al. 2018](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1316)), a genetic algorithm-based attack model (the complete executable code is [here](./examples/multiprocess_eval.py)).

```python
import OpenAttack as oa
import datasets

def dataset_mapping(x):
    return {
        "x": x["sentence"],
        "y": 1 if x["label"] > 0.5 else 0,
    }

victim = oa.loadVictim("BERT.SST")
dataset = datasets.load_dataset("sst", split="train[:20]").map(function=dataset_mapping)
attacker = oa.attackers.GeneticAttacker()
attack_eval = oa.AttackEval(attacker, victim)
# Using multiprocessing simply by specify num_workers
attack_eval.eval(dataset, visualize=True, num_workers=4)
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Chinese Attack</strong></summary>

OpenAttack now supports adversarial attacks against English and Chinese victim models. [Here](./examples/chinese.py) is an example code of conducting adversarial attacks against a Chinese review classification model using PWWS.
</details>

<details>

## Attack Models

According to the level of perturbations imposed on original input, textual adversarial attack models can be categorized into sentence-level, word-level, character-level attack models. 

According to the accessibility to the victim model, textual adversarial attack models can be categorized into `gradient`-based, `score`-based, `decision`-based and `blind` attack models.

> [TAADPapers](https://github.com/thunlp/TAADpapers) is a paper list which summarizes almost all the papers concerning textual adversarial attack and defense. You can have a look at this list to find more attack models.

Currently OpenAttack includes 15 typical attack models against text classification models that cover **all** attack types.

## Toolkit Design

Considering the significant distinctions among different attack models, we leave considerable freedom for the skeleton design of attack models, and focus more on streamlining the general processing of adversarial attacking and the common components used in attack models.

OpenAttack has 7 main modules: 

<img src="./docs/source/images/toolkit_framework.png" alt="toolkit_framework" style="zoom:40%;" />

* **TextProcessor**: processing the original text sequence to assist attack models in generating adversarial examples;
* **Victim**: wrapping victim models;
* **Attacker**: comprising various attack models;
* **AttackAssist**: packing different word/character substitution methods that are used in word-/character-level attack models and some other components used in sentence-level attack models like the paraphrasing model;
* **Metric**: providing several adversarial example quality metrics that can serve as either the constraints on the adversarial examples during attacking or evaluation metrics for evaluating adversarial attacks;
* **AttackEval**: evaluating textual adversarial attacks from attack effectiveness, adversarial example quality and attack efficiency;
* **DataManager**: managing all data and saved models that are used in other modules.
